NAME                USED  AVAIL  REFER  MOUNTPOINT

bigpool/mynewfs  24.5K  4.81T  24.5K  /bigpool/mynewfs

The mount point defaults to /bigpool/mynewfs..let's say that I don't like that; in this case I don't have any data in the new file system so I can destroy it and start again...

root# cd bigpool/mynewfs

root# zfs destroy bigpool/mynewfs

cannot unmount '/bigpool/mynewfs': Device busy


I did this just to see what happened: OK, I proved that I cannot delete a busy file system...now...try again...


root# cd /

root# zfs destroy bigpool/mynewfs

root# zfs create -o mountpoint=/mynewfs bigpool/mynewfs

root# zfs list bigpool/mynewfs

NAME                USED  AVAIL  REFER  MOUNTPOINT

bigpool/mynewfs  24.5K  4.81T  24.5K  /mynewfs


Note that I am not having to edit /etc/vfstab or create the mount points: ZFS doesn't use /etc/vfstab unless you want it to (see  "Legacy Mountpoints" in the ZFS Administration Guide ) and ZFS creates the mount points for you as well..it is as simple as that.


I am fickle; I now want to change the mount point without destroying the file system...


root# zfs set mountpoint=/fickle bigpool/mynewfs

root# zfs list bigpool/mynewfs

NAME                USED  AVAIL  REFER  MOUNTPOINT

bigpool/mynewfs  24.5K  4.81T  24.5K  /fickle

Job done. By the way, this won't work if the file system is busy...see below..

root# cd /fickle

root# zfs set mountpoint=/ohnoyoudont bigpool/mynewfs

cannot unmount '/fickle': Device busy
