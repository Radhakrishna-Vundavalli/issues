Problem(Abstract)
================
Attempts to mount IBM Rational ClearCase VOBs result in an error, env: mount.mvfs: No such file or directory, on newly installed ClearCase 7.1 installations on Linux.
Symptom

You install ClearCase 7.1.x on Linux kernel but found that MVFS did not load, You then try to rebuild MVFS manually and it seems to work. Cleartool -ver does show MVFS is loaded but you are unable to mount VOBs which reports an error.

/usr/atria/bin/cleartool mount -a

env: mount.mvfs: No such file or directory


Cause
=====
The link found in /mount.mvfs is incorrect. This may be because an install was done to a non-default directory.

Diagnosing the problem

Make sure that the link for mount.mvfs points to the correct location.

"No such file or directory" indicates that the link points to a non-existent directory.

Resolving the problem

Find the link for mount.mvfs in /var/adm/rational/clearcase/mvfs/mvfs_src


Make sure it points to the right location.

cd /var/adm/rational/clearcase/mvfs/mvfs_src


Example:
# ls -la /sbin/mount.mvfs                                          

                                                                   

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 46 2010-08-09 15:36 /sbin/mount.mvfs ->      

/opt/ibm/RationalSDLC/clearcase/etc/mount_mvfs                                                                                        

# rm /sbin/mount.mvfs    


Correct the link by recreating the link to point to the location where ClearCase was installed.

# ln -s /whereitis/RationalSDLC/clearcase/etc/mount_mvfs

/sbin/mount.mvfs  


Try the mount command again to verify the fix.

/usr/atria/bin/cleartool mount -a
