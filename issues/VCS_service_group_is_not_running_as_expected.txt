================================================================================

these cluster resources have failed due to a high load on the system and the fact that VCS timeout value was reached on this resource on test155. this caused the oracle BD's to failed as the resources was offline.

working with the DBA's on this  in DEV/UAT and was going to perform some full testing for this, before we go live with production.

when the disk group failed the following DBs had issues..
LFRC01 LFRC02 LGRT01 LMDS01 LMRC01 LNCOM01 cvm

to resolve this we had to clear the HAstatus of the groups:

hagrp -clear LFRC01 LFRC02 LGRT01 LMDS01 LMRC01 LNCOM01 cvm test155

haconf -makerw
hatype -display CVMVolDg
hatype -modify CVMVolDg MonitorInterval 120
hatype -modify CVMVolDg MonitorTimeout 120
hatype -modify CVMVolDg AgentStartTimeout 120
hatype -modify CVMVolDg AttrChangedTimeout 120
hatype -modify CVMVolDg CleanTimeout 120
hatype -modify CVMVolDg CloseTimeout 120
hatype -modify CVMVolDg OpenTimeout 120
hatype -modify CVMVolDg ConfInterval 1200
hatype -modify CVMVolDg FaultOnMonitorTimeouts 5
hatype -modify CVMVolDg ToleranceLimit 4
haconf -dump -makero

after these steps the VCS service has restarted the oracle instances. this has been confirmed,

this service has been resumed with all the teams...
