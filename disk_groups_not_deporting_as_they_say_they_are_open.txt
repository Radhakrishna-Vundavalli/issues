	$ Summary: disk groups not deporting as they say they are open
	$ On-Call: NO

---++++ Details:
<pre>
Diskgroup - oramqdatadg cannot deport due to Veritas thinking it is busy with a mount even though the volumes are all disabled.

Doing the following command tells you that the volume is till busy -

# vxprint -g oramqdatadg -m LCIBMQ01_u01app_vol01 | grep devopen
        devopen=on

The reason for this is that the kernel still thinks there is a mount associated with this volume

# grep oramqdatadg /proc/mounts
/dev/vx/dsk/oramqdatadg/LCIBMQ01_u01app_vol01 /u01/app/oracle/LCIBMQ01 vxfs rw,delaylog,largefiles,ioerror=mwdisable 0 0

The only way to clear this is to reboot the server.
See the following link -

When the application team give you the go ahead could you reboot the server and make sure the diskgroup oramqdatadg is deported.
