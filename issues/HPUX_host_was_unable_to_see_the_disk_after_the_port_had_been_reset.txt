the san disks have multiple paths to each device and one side of them 
had disapeared due to a possible SAN issue. Pat fogarty from the san team 
was able to check the switch port and reset this. 

The reason that the HPUX host was unable to see the disk after the port 
had been reset was due to it being held in NVRAM or whatever the HPUX equiv is... 

so to resolve 

ioscan -F (full listing of all devs) 
ioscan -h 0/4/0 (this was the FC channel that lost the paths)
insf -H 0/4/0 <---- path from above to rebuild the devices 
vgchange -a y vg03 <---- this got HPUX to checl /dev/vg03/ area against /etc/lvmtab

to see the current ones used by this VG do... 

strings /etc/lvmtab
