        $ Summary: Unable to add a new disk to an existing disk group

---++++ Details:
<pre>

Problem

Unable to add a new disk to an existing diskgroup (DG) after upgrade to Veritas Volume Manager (VxVM) 5.1SP1RP3.
Error

# /usr/sbin/vxdg -g oradg adddisk 002oradg=emc2_0fe5
VxVM vxdg ERROR V-5-1-0 Disk Group oradg has only cloned disks and tyring to add standard disk to diskgroup. Mix of standard and cloned disks in a diskgroup is not allowed. Please follow the vxdg (1M) man page.
Environment

Solaris 10

VxVM 5.1SP1RP3
Cause

Prior to VxVM 5.1SP1RP3, vxdg adddisk command did not check whether the newly added disk is a clone or standard disk. 5.1SP1RP3 patch which introduced this check via e2815517 (vxdg adddisk should not allow mixing clone & non-clone disks in a DiskGroup) prevents mix of standard and clone disks in a DG.
Solution

If there is a mismatch of udid and udid_asl fields and/or clone_disk flag is set as seen in vxdisk -v list <disk> outputs, vxdisk updateudid needs to be run on the existing disks in the DG. This is explained in TECH196717.

 

*** Error when adding disk to DG:
# /usr/sbin/vxdg -g oradg adddisk 002oradg=emc2_0fe5
VxVM vxdg ERROR V-5-1-0 Disk Group oradg has only cloned disks and tyring to add standard disk to diskgroup. Mix of standard and cloned disks in a diskgroup is not allowed. Please follow the vxdg (1M) man page.

 

*** Only 2 disks in DG:

# grep oradg vxdisk_alldg_list
emc1_151f    auto:cdsdisk    001oradg  oradg   online
emc1_0511    auto:cdsdisk    000oradg  oradg   online

 

*** Both disks have mismatched udid which means that vxvm considers the disks as clone disks.

# grep udid vxdisk_list_emc1_151f
udid:      EMC%5FSYMMETRIX%5F000290104663%5F630151F008
tag      udid_asl=EMC%5FSYMMETRIX%5F104663%5F6351F008

# grep udid vxdisk_list_emc1_0511
udid:      EMC%5FSYMMETRIX%5F000290104663%5F6300511000
tag      udid_asl=EMC%5FSYMMETRIX%5F104663%5F63511000

 

*** Whereas the new disk has matching udid, which means it is considered as standard disk.

# grep udid vxdisk_list_emc2_0fe5
udid:      EMC%5FSYMMETRIX%5F000292600663%5F6300FE5000
tag      udid_asl=EMC%5FSYMMETRIX%5F000292600663%5F6300FE5000

# vxdg deport oradg
# vxdisk -fg oradg updateudid emc1_151f
# vxdisk -fg oradg updateudid emc1_0511
# vxdisk set emc1_151f clone=off
# vxdisk set emc1_0511 clone=off
# vxdg import oradg
#

 

*** Once the udid is fixed, you would be able to add the new disk to the DG:

# vxdg -g oradg adddisk 002oradg=emc2_0fe5
#
