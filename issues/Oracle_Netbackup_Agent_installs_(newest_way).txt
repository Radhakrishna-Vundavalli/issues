On Oracle servers we have to install the Netbackup Oracle agent. This will also need to be patched. If you are running on Netbackup Client version 6.5.3 (now standard as part of all new builds), then you will need to perform the following steps to add the agent and the pack  NB_ORA_6.5.2 (usually the Client and the oracle pack needs to be the same version, but 6.5.3 pack for Oracle has not been released. Confirmed with Symantec that this is ok) :-

You will need NBU_65_unix_options.tar.Z & NB_ORA_6.5.2.tar.Z. I have asked Andrew Brook to add them to all jet servers, but for now, the you can get it from /net/srumlms02/backup/GS_nbu_upgrade
