When replacing a root disk if in a failing state, you need to carry out the Veritas vxdiskadm opt 4 and then cfgadm -c unconfigure C#::c#t#d#

If the above fails with this error:

# cfgadm -c unconfigure c1::dsk/c1t0d0
cfgadm: Component system is busy, try again: failed to offline:
     Resource              Information
------------------  -------------------------
/dev/dsk/c1t0d0s2   Device being used by VxVM

Then carry out the following procedure:

1) Run the following command to rename 'es_rcm.pl' script.
# mv /etc/rcm/scripts/es_rcm.pl /etc/rcm/scripts/DONTUSE
NOTE: VxVM 4.1 and above 'es_rcm.pl' script is under /usr/lib/rcm/scripts
# mv /usr/lib/rcm/scripts/es_rcm.pl /usr/lib/rcm/scripts/DONTUSE
2) Run "/usr/sbin/cfgadm -c unconfigure ......" again. This command will finish successfully.
Example:
# /usr/sbin/cfgadm -c unconfigure c0::dsk/c0t0d0
3) After that, rename back file "DONTUSE" to the original name.
# mv /etc/rcm/scripts/DONTUSE /etc/rcm/scripts/es_rcm.pl
NOTE: VxVM 4.1 and above 'es_rcm.pl' script is under /usr/lib/rcm/scripts
# mv /usr/lib/rcm/scripts/DONTUSE /usr/lib/rcm/scripts/es_rcm.pl
4) Then physically replace the failed boot disk with new one.
5) Run the following command.
# cfgadm -c configure c0::dsk/c0t0d0
