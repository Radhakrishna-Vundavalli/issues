The following message is reported in the /var/adm/messages file of a 12k/15k domain:
  inetd[3008]: [ID 161378 daemon.error] sun-dr/tcp: bind: Address already in use 

This error is reported when dcs daemon is already running . Domain Configuration Server (DCS) is used for system board manipulation  by system controllers.
To resolve the problem, I killed the dcs process and restart inetd.
