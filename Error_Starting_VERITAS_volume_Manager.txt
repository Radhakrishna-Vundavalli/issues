==================

we have been having issues starting the OPSCO data volumes using  Veritas volume manager, they would not start and as a result, the backups would not start. 
We ran a vxconfigd -k this was hanging. we killed vxconffigd using vxdctl disable then enable. All volumes seem to be enabled active at the moment.

all volumes are now running 


# vxprint -Ath | egrep -i "(fail|nodev)"
