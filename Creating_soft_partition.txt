        $ Summary: Creating soft partition

---++++ Details:
<pre>
In the following example, a 4-Gbyte soft partition called d20 is created on c1t3d0s2.

# metainit d20 -p c1t3d0s2 4g



The following example creates a soft partition and formats disk c1t2d0. This action destroys any data on that disk and creates a new soft partition on slice 0.

# metainit d7 -p -e c1t2d0 1G



Specifying an existing slice and absolute offset and size values. For example:

# metainit d2 -p c1t0d0s0 -o 2048 -b 1024



The -o parameter signifies the offset into the slice, and the -b parameter is the size for the soft partition. 

All numbers are in blocks (a block is 512 bytes). The metainit command ensures that extents and soft partitions do not overlap.
