This example adds support for the print queue cs_co4_lj, an HP LaserJet printer, to a Solaris system (version 8) using Sun's lpset program. 
The local queue is also called cs_co3_lj. We make it the default queue on the system.

# lpset -n system -a bsdaddr=lpd-server
# lpset -n system -a use=cs_co4_lj _default
Syntax explained
lpset's syntax can be determined by reading the lpset(1) and printers.conf(4) manual pages. The salient points, however, are the following.

-n system 
This instructs lpset to update the /etc/printers.conf file as opposed to a NIS+ database. 
-a key=value 
The -a option sets a key=value pair for the relevant print queue. 
bsdaddr=lpd-serv
This key/value pair specifies, by its presence, that the BSD (lpd) style of communication should be used to talk to remote print server. The part of the value before the comma specifies the server's name and the part afterwards specifies the name of the print queue on the server. 
cs_co4_lj 
This specifies the local name for the print queue. We recommend that you match local and remote print queue names for ease of your user support. 
use=cs_co4_lj 
This key/value pair specifies what real queue to use for a queue name. It's a simple form of aliasing. 
_default 
This alias identifies the system's default printer and is typically only used with the use=... key/value pair.
