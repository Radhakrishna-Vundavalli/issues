	$ Summary: fault light on - alerted by HP engineer

---++++ Details:
<pre>
alerted by HP after a walkthrough that a fault light was on 
one of the netras -

Checked via the LOM (connect to console and then use #. to 
escape to the LOM) and there had been a short loss of power 
but that was all recovered;
lom>show eventlog
Eventlog:
   +392d+21h53m4s host reset
   +399d+21h49m9s host reset
   +406d+21h45m9s host reset

   +437d+7h41m11s Fault LED ON
   +437d+7h44m21s supply rail 6 recovered

examining the output of the "environment" command showed 
the fault light still on as well as one of the alarms, 
cleared both of those and reset the checking and went back 
to the console;
lom>faultoff
LOM event: +437d+13h55m48s Fault LED OFF
lom>alarmoff 3
LOM event: +437d+13h56m8s Alarm 3 OFF
