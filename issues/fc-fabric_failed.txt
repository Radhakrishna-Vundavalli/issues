Issue:-
======

While booting the solaris server we got Method /lib/svc/method/fc-fabric failed due to signal KILL

we tried all options and even rebooted the box trying different options but to no avail. Even after the Server coming to single user mode, the error still persisted. 
We tried by checking at svcs services as well. Finally was able to resolve the issue with the following solution.

Solution:
========
In /etc/cfg/fp,  we need to check for file starting with fabric_wwn*  and delete all the files which are starting with fabric_wwn*.
After doing so, the issue was resolved and we were able to boot the server successfully.
