	$ Summary: how to setup user ssh keys
	$ On-Call: NO

---++++ Details:
<pre>
1) Create a public and private key pair for the protocol you want to use (should allways be SSH2). 
To create a key pair for use by SSH2, enter: 

  /opt/ssh/bin/ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 1024

Note: For security reasons, strongly recommends using SSH2 when available instead of SSH.

You will be prompted to supply a file in which to save the key and a passphrase (use the default unless your already
using ssh keys). 
Press Enter through each of these prompts. If you do so, the key generation program will assume that you wish to use the default file name of id_dsa and your private key will not be protected by a password.

Note: UITS strongly recommends that you enter a password when generating a public and private key pair. If you choose not to use a password, anyone who gains access to your private key can authenticate to your account without a password.
The key generation program will create a private key in a file with the name you specified and a public key with the same name, plus a .pub extension.

2) Copy your public key to the remote host by entering: 
  scp ~/.ssh/filename.pub hostname: 
Replace hostname with the name of the remote host and filename.pub with the name of file containing your public key (this will end in the .pub extension).

3) Connect to the remote host using your password for authentication. If the authorized_keys file doesn't exist, create it with the following commands: 
  mkdir -p ~/.ssh
  touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 
If the directory and file do exist, running these commands will not damage them.

4) On the remote host, add your public key to the authorized_keys file, with the following command: 
  cat ~/filename.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 
Replace filename.pub with the name of the file containing your public key (this will end in the .pub extension).

5) If you want, you can now delete the public key file from your account on the remote host by entering the following: 
  rm ~/filename.pub 
If you would prefer to keep a copy of this file in your account, you can move it to the .ssh subdirectory by entering:

6) mv filename.pub ~/.ssh/ 
In both cases, replace filename.pub with the name of the file containing your public key.

Note: Follow steps 2-5 for each remote host you want to log into using public key authentication.
