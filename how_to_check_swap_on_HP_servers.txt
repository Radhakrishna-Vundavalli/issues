        $ Summary: how to check swap on HP servers

---++++ Details:
<pre>
In HP-UX you can use check physical memory allocated to server from command line as well as from SAM.I am going to describe here how to check memory on HP-UX from command line: 

1.) Checking phyiscal memory in HP-UX using dmesg : 

You can check memory in HP-UX using dmesg output. In HP-UX dmesg print HP-UX server messages and hardware information available to system during the boot time.Here is the command to check physical memory in HP-UX using dmesg output :

hp-uxdev# dmesg |grep Physical

Physical: 8388608 Kbytes, lockable: 5614168 Kbytes, available: 6461644 Kbytes 

In dmesg output memory is listed as 8388608 Kbytes or 8 GB.Note: in grep use P(upper) case in word physical to get memory information or “grep –i physical”

2.) Checking HP-UX memory using print_manifest :

HP-UX provides very useful command called print_manifest,i am going to use print_manifest to check how much memory is available :

hp-uxdev# print_manifest |grep –i memory

Main Memory: 8192 MB

Print_manifest is very handy command I don’t even have to 

3.) Checking HP-UX memory using cstm:

Check on your HP-UX server if you have cstm installed by running which cstm .If you have CSTM install on your HP-UX server , you can check Physical memory by running following command :

hp-uxdev# which cstm

hp-uxdev# /usr/sbin/cstm

hp-uxdev# print_manifest |grep -i memory
