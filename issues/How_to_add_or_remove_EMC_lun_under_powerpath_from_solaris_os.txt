Case 1. How to ADD EMC LUN under powerpath control in Solaris OS after assigning LUN from Storage

==================================================================================================

0) - tail -f /var/adm/messages (open another terminal session to get the Message for ...Corrupt label;

wrong magic number )

00) OPTIONAL (For Solaris 10 its not required, devfsadm -Cv --->ONLY required in Solaris 8/9 in case

disk has not been seen by OS)

Once LUN is assigned it will pop-up messages in message file. Format output will show the new disks

except pseudo name. Pseudo device will also apaear once powermt config command runs alongwith the newly

disks.

1) - /etc/powercf -q (----> Whenever you add or remove any LUN from server, run these command, it will

update the emcp.conf file (/kernel/drv/emcp.conf,)

2) - /etc/powermt display dev=all (--> At this stage LUN names will not appear on output but psuedo name

& all other details will appear. LUN name that are

assigned while creating LUN on storage end should

appear under Logical device but it will reflect once you run powermt config command.)

3) - /etc/powermt config (----->It will update /etc/powermt.custom file & powermt display will reflect

the LUN name under Logical device)

4) - /etc/powermt display dev=all --> (Once you see all paths are active, then run "powermt save"

command)

5) - /etc/powermt save

6) - Now run 'format' to put a label on the disks (format-->Select new pseudo disk (emcpower#)-->Y (when

propted for Label if its not used disk)-->quit

7)- SAN disk is ready to use with Volume management

Case2. How to REMOVE EMC LUN under powerpath control from Solaris OS

=====================================================================

1) Stop I/O to the device. [Unmount the filesystem ]

2) Remove the device from the volume managment.

3) Run the following command to determine the LUN pseudo (i.e. emcpower) device name that need to be

removed.

#/etc/powermt display dev=all

4) Remove the particular LUN from powerpath

a) #/etc/powermt remove dev=emcpower#

b) #/etc/powercf -q (--->whenever you add or remove any LUN from server, run these command, it will

update the emcp.conf file (/kernel/drv/emcp.conf)).

c) #/etc/powermt config (--->it will update /etc/powermt.custom file & powermt display will remove

the LUN name Logical device

Note: powermt config does not remove previously configured paths when they become dead paths. If c)

failed, use /etc/powermt check - to clear dead paths)

d) # /etc/powermt display dev=emcpower# (--> before saving configuration, check if LUN is removed

successfully)

e) # /etc/powermt save

5) [OPTIONAL] If found dead paths while excuting Step 4, run below commands

end change happended before removing it from powerpath)

#/etc/powermt check

#/etc/powercf -q

#/etc/powermt display dev=all (--> and check o/p status are okay)

#/etc/powermt save

(could be due to Stoarge

6) Now remove the LUN from the storage group/array or unmap it from SAN switch.

7) Verify the LUN if it is removed from server and not visible in server.

#/etc/powermt display dev=all

8) Remove the device from the device tree via the cfgadm or by devfsadm -Cv
