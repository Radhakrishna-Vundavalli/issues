	$ Summary: Repeated VxVm Disk Failure

---++++ Details:
<pre>
Problem:
 

Twice, I have received the disk failure IM for tcmus001 box.  

This problem is due to intermittent problems on EMC storage, 

which is causing repeated disk failure status for VxVm. 

This failed disk on OS side is working fine.  

 

You can fix this in minutes. I would like to share the method I follow.

 

Symptoms: 

 

1)  First check the disk failures for VxVm using vxdisk list.

 

 e.g Vxvm reports disk failure c21t2d2

 

 / # vxdisk -g dg03 list

DEVICE       TYPE      DISK         GROUP        STATUS

c21t2d0      simple    dg0301       dg03         online

c21t2d1      simple    dg0302       dg03         online

c21t2d3      simple    dg0304       dg03         online

c21t2d4      simple    dg0305       dg03         online

c21t2d5      simple    dg0306       dg03         online

         -            -         dg0303       dg03         failed was:c21t2d2

 

2) Check the status on OS Side for the failed disks,

 

e.g This  disk is visible to OS and the status is CLAIMED

 

 /etc/vx/bin # ioscan -funH 0/12/0/0.99.39.19.0.2.2

Class     I  H/W Path        Driver   S/W State   H/W Type     Description

===========================================================================

disk    258  0/12/0/0.99.39.19.0.2.2  sdisk    CLAIMED     DEVICE       EMC     SYMMETRIX

                            /dev/dsk/c21t2d2   /dev/rdsk/c21t2d2

 /etc/vx/bin #

 

3)   Note down the volume groups and volumes affected using vxprint .hrt and following 

e.g. 

 

 / # vxinfo -g dg03

lvol1          gen      Started

lvol15         gen      Started

lvol16         gen      Started

lvol17         gen      Started

lvol18         gen      Started

lvol19         gen      Started

lvol20         gen      Started

lvol21         gen      Started

lvol22         gen      Started

lvol23         gen      Started

lvol24         gen      Started

lvol14         gen      Started

lvol13         gen      Unstartable

lvol12         gen      Unstartable

lvol2          gen      Started

lvol3          gen      Started

lvol4          gen      Started

lvol5          gen      Started

lvol6          gen      Started

lvol7          gen      Started

lvol8          gen      Started

lvol9          gen      Unstartable

lvol10         gen      Unstartable

lvol11         gen      Unstartable

lvol25         gen      Started

 

4) Using vxdiskadm menu, choose option  .3     Remove a disk for replacement.. 

    During the removal process choose .none. for replacement disk.

 

Disk group: dg03

 

DM NAME         DEVICE       TYPE     PRIVLEN  PUBLEN   STATE

Enter disk name [<disk>,list,q,?] dg0303

 

  The following volumes will lose mirrors as a result of this

  operation:

 

        lvol10 lvol11 lvol12 lvol13 lvol9

 

  No data on these volumes will be lost.

 

  The following devices are available as replacements:

 

        c7t0d0 c7t0d1 c7t0d2 c7t0d3 c7t0d4 c7t0d5 c7t0d6 c7t0d7 c7t1d0 c7t1d1 c7t1d2 c7t1d3 c7t1d4 c7t1d5 c7t1d6 c7t1d7 

        c7t2d0 c7t2d1 c7t2d2 c7t2d3 c7t2d4 c7t2d5 c7t2d6 c7t2d7 c7t3d0 c7t3d1 c7t3d2 c7t3d3 c7t3d4 c7t3d5 c7t3d6 c7t3d7 

        c7t4d0 c7t4d1 c7t4d2 c7t4d3 c7t4d4 c7t4d5 c7t4d6 c7t4d7

 

  Select "none" if you do not wish to select one.

 

Choose a device, or select "none"

[<device>,none,q,?] (default: c7t0d0) none

 

  The requested operation is to remove disk dg0303 from disk group

  dg03.  The disk name will be kept, along with any volumes using

  the disk, allowing replacement of the disk.

 

  Select "Replace a failed or removed disk" from the main menu

  when you wish to replace the disk.

 

Continue with operation? [y,n,q,?] (default: y)

 

  Removal of disk dg0303 completed successfully.

 

c21t2d2      simple    -            -            online

 

5)  Quit vxdiskadm menu using  .q. 

     Execute following command to initialize the private area of  the disk and detecting the disk again

 

 /etc/vx/bin # ./vxdisksetup -f -i c21t2d2 

 /etc/vx/bin # vxdctl enable

 /etc/vx/bin # vxdisk scandisks

 

6) Go back to vxdiskadm, select menu .4      Replace a failed or removed disk.  

     Use the same disk as a replacement disk.

 

e.g. Enter dg0303 as a disk to be replaced and c21t2d2 as a replacement disk.

 

 

  The following devices are available as replacements:

 

        c7t0d0 c7t0d1 c7t0d2 c7t0d3 c7t0d4 c7t0d5 c7t0d6 c7t0d7 c7t1d0 c7t1d1 c7t1d2 c7t1d3 c7t1d4 c7t1d5 c7t1d6 c7t1d7 c7t2d0 

        c7t2d1 c7t2d2 c7t2d3 c7t2d4 c7t2d5 c7t2d6 c7t2d7 c7t3d0 c7t3d1 c7t3d2 c7t3d3 c7t3d4 c7t3d5 c7t3d6 c7t3d7 c7t4d0 c7t4d1 

        c7t4d2 c7t4d3 c7t4d4 c7t4d5 c7t4d6 c7t4d7 c21t2d2

 

  Select "none" if you do not wish to select one.

 

Choose a device, or select "none"

[<device>,none,q,?] (default: c7t0d0) c21t2d2

 

7) Check disk is online and part of the right disk group using vxdisk list.

 

8)  Force starts each volume using following,

 

      vxvol  -g  dg03 -f  lvol9 start
