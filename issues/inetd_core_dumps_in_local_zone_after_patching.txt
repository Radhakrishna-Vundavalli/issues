if you've seen this before, but after patching Solaris 10 to the latest level, inetd in the local zones keeps core dumping 
This obviously means none of your other inet services will start 

It seems that you need to manually set the connection_backlog parameter of gss as per below 

inetadm -M connection_backlog=10 
Once this is done, enabling the inetd svc kicks everthing into life. Thanks to Sun Support for this one as there was on sunsolve....
