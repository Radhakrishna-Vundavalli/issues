Increase size of snapshot and parent volume for PFIbatchprogvl_01/batchprogvl
Symantec suggested mounting the snapshot volume to be increased and grow it in this fashion due to a known issue with the vxassist growto command when dcl logs are involved:
mount -F vxfs /dev/vx/dsk/testdb11dg/PFIbatchprogvl_01 /mnt

./vxresize -b -F vxfs -g testdb11dg PFIbatchprogvl_01 1090g alloc=528testdb11dn,529testdb11dn,530testdb11dn,531testdb11dn,532testdb11dn,539testdb11dn,545testdb11dn,546testdb11dn,521testdb11dn,522testdb11dn,523testdb11dn

VxVM vxresize ERROR V-5-1-4703 Problem running vxassist command for volume PFIbatchprogvl_01, in diskgroup testdb11dg

However, the vxresize command terminated with an error. Again, it looks like it is part of an known incident in the Volume manager code for the superseded and now End-of-Live version 5.0mp1rp3.

Symantec suggests disassociating the snapshot volume from its parent and trying to unprepared [remove DCO log volume], then try to grow the snapshot volume:

vxsanp -g testdb11dg dis PFIbatchprogvl_01
vxsnap -g testdb11dg unprepare PFIbatchprogvl_01
vxsnap -g testdb11dg -f unprepare PFIbatchprogvl_01
VxVM vxassist ERROR V-5-1-10127 changing volume PFIbatchprogvl_2d_dcl:

        Operation requires transaction


The unprepare errors out unexpectedly. Symantec suggest increasing a volume manager tunable so the operation would not time out and restart vxconfigd. Symantec also cautious us that this could induce a machine panic. So, we declined to go ahead with this solution.


Symantec suggest increasing another tuneable that can be changed temporarily on the fly and then try to unprepare the snapshot volume again:

export VXVM_TRANS_MAX_TIMEOUT=3000

vxtune volpagemod_max_memsz 524288

vxconfigd -k 

vxsnap -g testdb11dg -f unprepare PFIbatchprogvl_01

VxVM vxassist ERROR V-5-1-10127 changing volume PFIbatchprogvl_2d_dcl:

        Operation requires transaction

We run into the same problem again.

Symantec suggests to take an outage, failover the ServiceGroup where the snapshot volume is located to a standby server where we would prior set the tuneable for vxconfigd. However we could not go down this road without an outage.

In a conference call, it was decided to go for complete the change with incident.

Backout needed to re-establish the snapshot:

test $ vxsnap -g testdb11dg make source=batchprogvl/snapvol=PFIbatchprogvl_01/sync=yes


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Need to resize the parent volume called batchprogvl. The snapshot was successfully increased a week ago.

Increasing the batchprogvl succeeded without problems.

./vxresize -b -F vxfs -g testdb09dg batchprogvl 1090g alloc,084testdb09dn,085testdb09dn,086testdb09dn,087testdb09dn,088testdb09dn,089testdb09dn,095testdb09dn,096testdb09dn,097testdb09dn,098testdb09dn


$ df -h|grep batchprog
