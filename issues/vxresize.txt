For example, the following command resizes a volume from 1 GB to 10 GB. The volume is homevol in the disk group mydg, and contains a VxFS file system. The command uses spare disks mydg10 and mydg11.

# vxresize -g mydg -b -F vxfs -x -t homevolresize homevol 10g mydg10 mydg11
 (or) alloc=mydg10,mydg11

The -b option specifies that this operation runs in the background. To monitor its progress, specify the task tag homevolresize with the vxtask command.


-x Requires that the operation represent an increase in the volume length. Fail the operation otherwise.

Points to remember while resizing a volume

 
2. In some situations, when resizing large volumes, vxresize may take a long time to complete.

3. Resizing a volume with a usage type other than FSGEN or RAID5 can result in loss of data. Use the -f option to force resizing of such a volume.

4. You cannot resize volumes comprised of different layout types. If you try to do so, an error message displays stating that the volume contains a different organization. (VxVM vxresize ERROR V-5-1-2536 Volume volume has different
)
5.  To resize such a volume successfully, you must first reconfigure it so that each data plex has the same layout.



Note :- 
If you enter an incorrect volume size, do not try to stop the vxresize operation by entering Crtl-C. Let the operation complete and then rerun vxresize with the correct value.
The new_length operand can begin with a plus (+) or minus (-) to indicate that the new length is added to or subtracted from from the current volume length. Specify the new length, or change in length, in Veritas Volume Manager standard length units
Verify the diskgroup version whether it's matched with VxVM version.
