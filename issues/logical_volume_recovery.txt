The procedure varies a bit depending upon whether or not it is a boot disk. In either case, it is NOT necessary (or desired) to do a pvcreate. These are the two procedures but this does assume that all LVOL's on the disk ARE MIRRORED.

Assume the disk is c2t5d0 in vg01.

If NOT a boot disk:

vgcfgrestore -n /dev/vg01 /dev/rdsk/c2t5d0
vgchange -a y /dev/vg01
vgsync /dev/vg01

Assume the disk is c2t5d0 in vg00 and IS a mirrored boot disk:

vgcfgrestore -n /dev/vg00 /dev/rdsk/c2t5d0
vgchange -a y /dev/vg00
mkboot /dev/rdsk/c2t5d0
mkboot -a "hpux -lq (;0)/stand/vmunix" /dev/rdsk/c2t5d0
lvlnboot -R
vgsync /dev/vg00

Note that if you always use hot-plug disks there is absolutely no reason to shutdown.
