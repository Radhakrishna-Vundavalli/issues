Problem occurred with filesystem corruption of /u100 on 354 (/dev/vx/dsk/ora354datdg/v_u100).

Unmounted, fsck'd and re-mounted /u100.

This filesystem is also NFS mounted on 065 and 070 server.

Attempting to re-mount /u100 on these servers results in the message:

nfs mount: mount: /u100: Stale NFS file handle

Solution: restart NFS server (/etc/init.d/nfs.server) on 354
