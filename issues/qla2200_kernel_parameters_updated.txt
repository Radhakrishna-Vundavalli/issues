	$ Summary:  qla2200 kernel parameters updated

---++++ Details:

numerous repeated errors on one of the HBAs.  after HEAT 
report from EMC, decided to go ahead and update following
parameters in the /kernel/drv/qla2200.conf file;

hba0-connection-option - currently set to 2 which implies 
Loop is preferred otherwise Point-to-Point. As we use only 
Point-to-Point, this should be set to 1. This setting 
should also eliminate the warnings related to the hard-loop-ID

hba0-execution-throttle - currently set at 16, EMC 
recommends 20. This change should not cause any performance 
problems on the disk subsystem but may prevent commands 
from backing up on the server.

hba0-fc-tape - currently set to 1 which implies that tape 
support is enabled. This should be disabled (set to 0)

hba0-persistent-binding-configuration - current set to 0. 
As persistant binding is in use, this should be set to 1.

hba0-extended-logging - currently enabled (set to 1). 
Unless this has been turned on for a specific reason it 
should be disabled (set to 0)
