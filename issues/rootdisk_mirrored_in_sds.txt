	$ Summary: rootdisk mirrored in sds

---++++ Details:
<pre>
went to mirror the rootdisk using SDS and found that the installation
of the SUNWmd package wasn't any good...devices were not there etc. 
(probably due to me...I believe that I copied over the whole /dev
tree so that we could run the box on the netra).

so, removed them and reinstalled SUNWmd from the Solaris 2.6 CD that
we have in the cupboard ("Solaris Server Intranet Extensions 1.0" CD).
(did abortively try to install DiskSuite 4.2.1 off the jumpstart 
server, but apparently this version is not supported for either 2.6 
or 7) 

then had to reboot to let it create devices, etc.

then could finally start setting up the rootdisk for mirroring;

metadb -a -c 3 -f c0t1d0s7
metadb -a -c 3 c0t0d0s7
metainit -f d10 1 1 c0t1d0s0
metainit d0 -m d10
metaroot d0
metainit -f d11 1 1 c0t1d0s1
metainit -f d14 1 1 c0t1d0s4
metainit -f d15 1 1 c0t1d0s5
metainit -f d16 1 1 c0t1d0s6
metainit -f d20 1 1 c0t0d0s0
metainit -f d21 1 1 c0t0d0s1
metainit -f d24 1 1 c0t0d0s4
metainit -f d25 1 1 c0t0d0s5
metainit -f d26 1 1 c0t0d0s6
metainit d1 -m d11
metainit d4 -m d14
metainit d5 -m d15
metainit d6 -m d16
cp vfstab vfstab.nosds
vi vfstab

and change entries to the sds ones..

/dev/md/dsk/d1  -		 -		 swap	 -		 no		-
/dev/md/dsk/d0  /dev/md/rdsk/d0 /		 ufs	  1		 no		-
/dev/md/dsk/d4  /dev/md/rdsk/d4 /Quasar			ufs	  2		 yes	  -
#/dev/md/dsk/d5 /dev/md/rdsk/d5 /SunAccounts	 ufs	  3		 yes	  -
/dev/md/dsk/d6  /dev/md/rdsk/d6 /REPOSITORY1	 ufs	  4		 yes	  -

then reboot (init 6) and let it mount sds volumes.  then you can attach
the mirrors;

metattach d0 d20
metattach d1 d21
metattach d4 d24
metattach d5 d25
metattach d6 d26

and watch until it's all finished;
# metastat |grep progress
	 Resync in progress: 3 % done
	 Resync in progress: 85 % done
	 Resync in progress: 16 % done
	 Resync in progress: 68 % done
	 Resync in progress: 21 % done
# 

and also need to make the root mirror bootable

# installboot /usr/platform/`uname -i`/lib/fs/ufs/bootblk /dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s0		

and the OBP settings were also updated;
# eeprom nvramrc='devalias rootdisk /pci@1f,0/pci@1,1/scsi@2/sd@1,0:a
> devalias rootmirror /pci@1f,0/pci@1,1/scsi@2/sd@0,0:a'
root@lonuxsa001 # eeprom boot-device="disk1 disk0 rootdisk rootmirror"


</pre>
