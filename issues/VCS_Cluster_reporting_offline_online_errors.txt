The original fault reported by OPs was as follows,

2006/03/28 14:12:28 VCS INFO V-16-1-10307 Resource mrc-etl-job (Owner: unknown, Group: Datastage) is offline on 095 (Not initiated by VCS)

Looking in the =engine_A.log= (/var/VRTSvcs/log)you will see these errors have been occurring since the day dot on the cluster.  The error relating to =trigger for resfault= is a furfy as the script is not there but it's very interesting what is going on with the offline/online problems.

Firstly let's look at the resource which is at the heart of the problem, =mrc-etl-job=

Looking at the ArgListValues,

mrc-etl-job  ArgListValues	 094	mrcadm "/mrc/script/MRC_ETL.sh -start dsp_mrc_prd /mrc/ds/dsp_mrc_prd/prm/mrc_etl_conf.xml" "/mrc/script/MRC_ETL.sh -stop dsp_mrc_prd /mrc/ds/dsp_mrc_prd/prm/mrc_etl_conf.xml" "" "" 0 1 "phantom DSD.RUN dssMrcMainSequence.VEX_START 0/0/0/0/0"

you can see it's monitoring the following process string

"phantom DSD.RUN dssMrcMainSequence.VEX_START 0/0/0/0/0"

An easier way to see this is in the =main.cf= file,

 Application mrc-etl-job (
					 Critical = 0
					 User = mrcadm
					 StartProgram = "/mrc/script/MRC_ETL.sh -start dsp_mrc_prd /mrc/ds/dsp_mrc_prd/prm/mrc_etl_conf.xml"
					 StopProgram = "/mrc/script/MRC_ETL.sh -stop dsp_mrc_prd /mrc/ds/dsp_mrc_prd/prm/mrc_etl_conf.xml"
					 MonitorProcesses = {
								 "phantom DSD.RUN dssMrcMainSequence.VEX_START 0/0/0/0/0" }
					 )

*NOW* from what I have observed it looks like the process ="phantom DSD.RUN dssMrcMainSequence.VEX_START 0/0/0/0/0"= dies or finishes every now and then and *sometimes* this coincides with VCS running its monitor.  Now if VCS notices the process is not running the following error will be seen,

2006/03/28 14:12:28 VCS INFO V-16-1-10307 Resource mrc-etl-job (Owner: unknown, Group: Datastage) is offline on 095 (Not initiated by VCS)

as according to VCS the process was "stopped" or "killed" outside of cluster.  However when the VCS monitor checks next time the Application has created a new process with the exact same process string and VCS thinks all is Hunky Dory (O worship Mr. Bowie) and issues the next message,

2006/03/28 14:17:28 VCS INFO V-16-1-10299 Resource mrc-etl-job (Owner: unknown, Group: Datastage) is online on 095 (Not initiated by VCS)

and cleans up all its failed flags etc....

If you look at the process VCS is monitoring it appears to be the parent process of other jobs,

---+++Summary

As this appears to be a problem since day one the ticket was sent to the Apps group to explain what the app is doing.  It may be fixed by changing one of the timeout values but that is really a sticky plaster approach.  Awating more info.....  Of course we could still be missing something :-)

If you look at the resource you will see it is set to non-critical.  One could believe this was set so this issue did not fail the services to the other node.

For completeness the VCS Type is =Application=, this is just a default bucket for any app.  The setting are,
