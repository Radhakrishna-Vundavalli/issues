LDom creation/installation setup - step by step 

Virtualization - Using logical domains (LDom)

You have heard about this word  "virtualization" now days in the  IT world. Logical domains (LDOM) is one of the para virtualization available with the Sun Sparc T1 and T 2 systems(Sun4v).   You can follow these simple steps to create your logical domains on your T1 and T2 systems. If you want to try it on x86 boxes , please use XEN

Before going to the install, understand the  key components in LDOM's.

Hypervisor

Software piece works on the top of the hardware. Responsible for maintaining the isolation of domains. Interacts between the hardware  and the OS.

Control Domain

 Creats and manages the other logical domains ans service and services

Service, I/O domains

Provides the virtual network switch or virtual disk

Guest Domain

Uses the services from the services and I/O domains and is managed by the control domain. In broad term , can be  considered as the additional OS which will get  installed on the machine

Virtual devices

.All the guest domains will be accessing the virtual devices. Like CPU,memory MAU,NIC,Disks,Consoles. 

Ldom manager

Controls hypervisor and all domains. It can run in any domain, but only 1 domain at a time. its a Cli utilty exposes to the administrator. maps logical domains to physical resources.

Now its ready for action:---

Get a T1000 or T2000 box

Install Solaris 10 U3 or higher

Connect to Service processor or SC to check the firmware version

sc> show host


Host flash versions:

Hypervisor 1.4.1 2007/04/02 16:37

OBP 4.26.1 2007/04/02 16:26

POST 4.26.0 2007/03/26 16:45

Upgrade  your system firmware  if its below 6.4.2. If its below 6.4.2 , please follow the instruction mention at the bottom of this page or refer the firmware upgrade docs.

Check the OS verison and patch level

# uname -a 

SunOS 5.10 Generic_118833-36 sun4v sparc SUNW,Sun-Fire-T200

# pkginfo -x | grep jass

upgrade the OS level or add the patches/packages

-bash-3.00# patchadd 125043-xx

-bash-3.00# pkgadd -d SUNWldm

-bash-3.00# pkgadd -d SUNWjass

Ensure that the install packages and services are running

-bash-3.00# ldm bind-domain myldom1

-bash-3.00# ldm start-domain myldom1

Now  your ldom is ready .You can follow the below steps to get your virtualized console 

>-bash-3.00# telnet localhost 5000

Trying 127.0.0.1...

Connected to localhost....

Escape character is '\^}'.

Connecting to console “myldom1” in group “myldom1” ....

/virtual-devices@100/channel-devices@200/network@0 has been selected.

Type \^Y ( Control-Y ) to insert it in the command line.

e.g. ok nvalias mydev \^Y

         for creating devalias mydev for /virtual-devices@100/channel-devices@200/network@0

{0} ok  nvalias vnet0 /virtual-devices@100/channel-devices@200/network@0

{0} ok boot vnet0 

This will start the installation of Solaris from the jumpstart server in the network. Make sure you have added  this mac id generated for ldom in the /etc/ethers file of your jumpstart server to start it.

To use file as virtual disk to install  Solaris on Guest domain

# /usr/sbin/mkfile 5G /ldoms/disk-images/s10-5g.img

# ldm add-vdsdev /ldoms/disk-images/s10-5g.img vol2@primary-vds0
