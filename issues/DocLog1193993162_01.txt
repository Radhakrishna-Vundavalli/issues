Parag,
 
I cannot guarantee all the data will be there as I am unsure why the private region has been stepped on, however, I would replace the disk with themselves and if the data is all intact, the volumes/file-systems will be fine once done.
 
NOTE:  First you will need to determine exactly what the disk access names changed to.
 
Once you know which disk is which:
 
# vxdg -g bimidumpdg -k rmdisk bimidumpd24
# vxdg -g bimidumpdg -k rmdisk bimidumpd27
# vxdg -g oradumpdg -k rmdisk oradumpd21
# vxdg -g oradatadg -k rmdisk oradatd04
 
You should now see them in a "removed was" state at the bottom of the disk list.
then add them back with:

# vxdg -g bimidumpdg -k adddisk bimidumpd24=EMC_CLARiiON0_XX
# vxdg -g bimidumpdg -k adddisk bimidumpd27=EMC_CLARiiON0_XX
# vxdg -g oradumpddg -k adddisk oradumpd21=EMC_CLARiiON_XX
# vxdg -g oradatadg -k adddisk oradat04=EMC_CLARiiON0_XX
 
Since the volumes are single plex, you can simply force start them.
 
# vxvol -g $diskgroup -f start $volume
 
NOTE: The file-system is either good or bad and the above command will not affect either way.
 
You can then if vxfs:
 
# fsck -F vxfs /dev/vx/rdsk/$diskgroup/$volume
 
NOTE:  The above is a log replay and non-intrusive.

Hope this helps,
