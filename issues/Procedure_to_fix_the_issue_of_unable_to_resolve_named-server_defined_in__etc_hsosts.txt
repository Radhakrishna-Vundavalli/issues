Description:
Unable to resolve server name defined in /etc/hosts,  command "getent hosts server-name" returned nothing instead of
returning the IP address associated with the server-name.
For example:
$ grep testserver /etc/hosts
192.168.1.30   testserver.com
$
$ getent hosts testserver.com                    <<<<<  Cannot resolve testserver.com as getent command returned nothing.
$

To fix this issue, restart the nscd (Name Service Cache daemon) however before restarting nscd we need to perform the following test
to determine if or if not the nscd and hostname resolution for local hosts works fine on that system (this test is recommended by Oracle
Support for root cause analysis purpose):

a) Ensure the nscd daemon is running in the system
b) Run the command "date;getent hosts bla.foo.com"
if that does not return an entry the nscd will keep that name for 5 seconds in it's negative cache
c) Do quickly add a line with "1.2.3.4 bla.foo.com" to the /etc/hosts
d) Run the command "date;getent hosts bla.foo.com" again 2 times
- if 1st time is <5 seconds later than step b) was executed the command is expected to return no entry
- if 1st and/or 2nd time is >5 seconds later than step b) was executed the command is expected to return "1.2.3.4 bla.foo.com"
If it won't behave as described here, we need to collect trusses to find out the reason why.

Collect the following debug information:
1. start a very verbose truss on the PID of the nscd daemon:
# truss -eflda -rall -wall -vall -u a.out:: -u nss*:: -o /var/tmp/truss_nscd -p <PID of nscd>

2. repeat the getent command that has failed and also truss that:
# truss -eflda -rall -wall -vall -u a.out:: -u nss*:: -u libnsl::gethost*,getip* -u libresolv -o /var/tmp/truss_getent getent hosts <hostname>

3. stop the truss that was started in step 1. after the issue will have been noticed in step 2.

The result of the test output from two truss commands will be sent to Oracle later for root cause analysis.

Now we can restart the nscd daemon.

Now the getent command should work hence the issue is resolved, for example:
# grep testserver /etc/hosts
192.168.1.30   testserver.com
# getent hosts testserver.com
192.168.1.30    testserver.com
