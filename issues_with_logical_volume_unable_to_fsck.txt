	$ Summary: issues with logical volume unable to fsck
	$ On-Call: UNSPECIFIED

---++++ Details:
<pre>
We had an issue trying to fsck /dev/vg00/lvol11

/etc/VRTSvcs/conf/config # fsck /dev/vg00/lvol11
fsck 1.38 (30-Jun-2005)
e2fsck 1.38 (30-Jun-2005)
Couldn't find ext2 superblock, trying backup blocks...
fsck.ext2: Bad magic number in super-block while trying to open /dev/vg00/lvol11

The superblock could not be read or does not describe a correct ext2
filesystem.  If the device is valid and it really contains an ext2
filesystem (and not swap or ufs or something else), then the superblock
is corrupt, and you might try running e2fsck with an alternate superblock:
    e2fsck -b 8193 <device>

fsck.ext2 /dev/vg00/lvol11 failed (status 0x8). Run manually!


on investigation it was discovered the blockdevice was different under 
vgdisplay vg00

  Block device           253:6

brw-------   1 root root 253, 21 May 21 14:23 vg00-lvol11


We performed a 

vgchange -ay
This re-enables a re-reads the logical volumes

This then changed the block device 

brw-------   1 root root 253,  6 Jun 25 15:46 vg00-lvol11

We were then able to fsck the filesystem and mount the filesytem.
