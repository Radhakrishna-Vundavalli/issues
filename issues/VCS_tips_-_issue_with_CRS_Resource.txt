        $ Summary: VCS tips - issue with CRS Resource

---++++ Details:
<pre>
Since two week I have came across three similar VCS issue where one of the DB resource group is faulted since a CRS resource is not getting up & we have been transferring it Apps/DB team. 

There could be multiple reason for that, but the one you need to check first is "oracle" user login status.. 
#su - oracle            >>>> you get "no directory"

Root cause > Permission of oracle home directory has been changed which is not allowing oracle to login to system during "crs" resource start up & resulting a faulted state. And there wont be any indication of that in any of the system log file including engine_A.log . 

Action > check & change the permission of /opt (mostly you need to provide 755 to /opt FS) & start the resource group.
</pre>
